# Crab-Age-Prediction-EDA
- This project focuses on predicting Crab Age. The project includes machine learning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization techniques to gain insights into the dataset and understand its patterns. The project uses the CrabAgePrediction.csv dataset, which can be downloaded from Kaggle:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sidhus/crab-age-prediction
# ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

### DATA CONTENT
- Crab is very tasty and many countries of the world import huge amount of crabs for consumption every year. The main benefits of crab farming are, labor cost is very low, production cost is comparatively lower and they grow very fast. Commercial crab farming business is developing the lifestyle of the people of coastal areas. By proper care and management we can earn more from crab farming business than shrimp farming. You can raise mud crabs in two systems. Grow out farming and fattening systems.

- Sex: Gender of the Crab - Male, Female and Indeterminate.
- Length: Length of the Crab (in Feet; 1 foot = 30.48 cms)
- Diameter: Diameter of the Crab (in Feet; 1 foot = 30.48 cms)
- Height: Height of the Crab (in Feet; 1 foot = 30.48 cms)
- Weight: Weight of the Crab (in ounces; 1 Pound = 16 ounces)

- Shucked Weight: Weight without the shell (in ounces; 1 Pound = 16 ounces)

- Viscera Weight: is weight that wraps around your abdominal organs deep inside body (in ounces; 1 Pound = 16 ounces)

- Shell Weight: Weight of the Shell (in ounces; 1 Pound = 16 ounces)

- Age: Age of the Crab (in months)

## Conclusion 
* In This Project, I built a model of Crab Age Prediction with some regression algorithms like  Gradient Boosting Regressor,XGBoost Regressor,LightGBM Regressor,Random Forest Regressor after evaluating some regression algorithms. I have explored lots of insights by visualizing the dataset and I got 0.62 R2 score from GradientRegressor model.
